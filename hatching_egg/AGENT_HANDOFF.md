# Hatching Egg Spider - Agent Handoff

**Status:** âœ… 100% COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 (Session 8)

---

## Project Complete

This project is **production-ready** with no outstanding tasks. All features implemented and tested.

### What It Does

4-servo hatching spider egg with 14-step progressive speed sequence:
- **Idle:** Cycles resting â†” slow_struggle continuously
- **Triggered (Pin 9):** 36-second dramatic sequence building to violent climax, ending exhausted
- **Emotional Arc:** Testing â†’ Escalation â†’ Desperation â†’ Violence â†’ Exhaustion

See `README.md` for complete usage and `STATUS.md` for full status.

## Quick Reference

**Upload & Monitor:**
```bash
pixi run upload   # Upload production code
pixi run monitor  # View serial output
```

**Testing:**
```bash
pixi run test     # All 241 tests (C++ + Python + JavaScript)
```

**Hardware:**
- DFRobot Beetle (Leonardo) - Pin 9 trigger
- PCA9685 PWM Driver (I2C 0x40)
- 4x Servos (2x HS-322HD + 2x DS-3225MG)
- Calibrated PWM ranges in `animation-config.json`

## Key Files

**Code:**
- `arduino/hatching_egg/hatching_egg.ino` - Production code with 14-step progressive speed sequence
- `animation-config.json` - Single source of truth for all config
- `arduino/animation_tester/` - Interactive tester for development

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - User guide
- `STATUS.md` - Project status & behavior details
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete history

**Tests (241 total):**
- 44 C++ tests (servo mapping)
- 20 Python tests (config validation + buffer overflow check)
- 34 C++ tests (servo tester)
- 93 C++ tests (servo sweep)
- 31 JavaScript tests (kinematics & PWM)
- 19 JavaScript tests (animation behaviors)

## Deployment Notes

**Production Ready:**
- All animations tested on hardware without crashes
- Memory optimized (12,898 bytes program / 506 bytes RAM)
- Buffer overflow fixed and tested
- Progressive speed system working (0.3x to 2.5x)

**No Outstanding Issues**

## For Future Modifications

If you need to modify animations:
1. Edit `animation-config.json`
2. Run `pixi run test` to verify safety
3. Run `pixi run generate-config` to regenerate headers
4. Run `pixi run upload` to flash

**Progressive Speed System:**
Edit `triggeredSequence[]` and `triggeredSequenceSpeed[]` arrays in `hatching_egg.ino` to change sequence.
