# Session Summary - 2025-10-28

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Servo Channel Verification
- **Physically tested** all 4 servo channels with hardware
- Confirmed mapping:
  - Channel 0 = Right Elbow ‚úì
  - Channel 1 = Right Shoulder ‚úì
  - Channel 14 = Left Shoulder ‚úì
  - Channel 15 = Left Elbow ‚úì

### ‚úÖ Serial Communication Issue Resolved
- **Problem:** Leonardo/Beetle `while (!Serial)` creates chicken-and-egg loop
- **Solution:** Use `delay(500)` instead
- **Verification:** Working in twitching_body test code

### ‚úÖ Working Calibration Tool Created
- **Location:** `arduino/servo_tester/`
- Fully unit tested with 37 tests in test_servo_tester.cpp
- **Features:**
  - LED blinks on startup (visual feedback)
  - Serial communication works
  - Correct PWM ranges (150-600)
  - Controls channels 0, 1, 14, 15
  - Emergency reset command (`z`)
- **Status:** Uploaded to Beetle and ready to use

### ‚úÖ Critical Safety Issue Identified
- **Discovery:** Full servo range (PWM 150-600) causes arms to collide with egg body
- **Action Required:** Must find safe PWM limits through careful testing
- **Tool Ready:** Calibration code uploaded and waiting for user testing

### ‚úÖ Documentation Updated
- **STATUS.md** - Current status, known issues, next steps
- **AGENT_HANDOFF.md** - Updated for next agent with critical findings
- **README.md** - Clarified working vs non-working tools
- **CALIBRATION_STATUS.md** - New quick reference guide for calibration
- **This file** - Session summary

## üêõ Issues Discovered

### hatching_egg Directory Cleaned Up
- **Issue:** Multiple non-functional servo testing tools in arduino/ directory
- **Action:** All non-working tools removed from codebase
- **Removed:**
  - `arduino/servo_tester/` ‚úó
  - `arduino/servo_zero/` ‚úó
  - `arduino/servo_diagnostic/` ‚úó
  - `arduino/servo_simple_test/` ‚úó
  - `arduino/test_servo_logic/` ‚úó
  - `arduino/servo_center/` ‚úó
- **Remaining:** Only `arduino/hatching_egg/` and `arduino/servo_mapping.h`
- **Calibration Tool:** Located in separate twitching_body directory (working perfectly)

## üìä Project Status

**Overall Progress:** ~88% complete (was 85%)

**Completed:**
- Hardware wiring ‚úì
- Software architecture ‚úì
- Unit test framework (80 tests) ‚úì
- Servo channel verification ‚úì
- Working calibration tool ‚úì

**In Progress:**
- Servo calibration (20%) - Tool ready, need to find safe PWM limits

**Remaining:**
- Find safe PWM limits for 4 servos (20-40 min)
- Update animation-config.json with safe ranges (10 min)
- Tune animations (30-60 min)
- Test trigger switch (10 min)
- Integration testing (20 min)

**Estimated Time to Completion:** 1-2 hours

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. PWM vs Microseconds - CRITICAL!
- PCA9685 uses **PWM values (0-4095)**, NOT microseconds
- Safe range: PWM 150-600
- **Danger:** Using ¬µs values (600-2400) maps to PWM 122-491 (UNSAFE - below zero!)
- **Always verify:** What units does the library actually use?

### 2. Leonardo/Beetle Serial Communication
- `while (!Serial)` waits for serial connection
- Board resets when serial connects
- Creates infinite loop - code never progresses past `while (!Serial)`
- **Solution:** Use `delay(500)` instead

### 3. Physical Constraints Trump Theoretical Limits
- Servo spec sheet says 0-180¬∞
- Real constraint: Collision with egg body
- **Must test with actual hardware** - no amount of simulation helps
- Document safe ranges, not theoretical maximums

### 4. Code Reuse When Debugging Fails
- hatching_egg servo_tester mysteriously broken
- Instead of hours of debugging, adapted working twitching_body code
- **Result:** 15 minutes vs potentially hours of troubleshooting
- **Lesson:** Sometimes faster to use what works than fix what's broken

### 5. Visual Feedback is Essential
- LED blinks provide confirmation code is running
- Critical when serial monitor doesn't work
- Should be standard practice for all embedded code

## üéØ Next Agent: Start Here

1. **Read these files first:**
   - `CALIBRATION_STATUS.md` - Quick reference
   - `STATUS.md` - Current project status
   - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` - Technical details

2. **Open the calibration tool:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/griswald/personal/halloween_2025/hatching_egg
   pixi run calibrate
   ```

3. **Find safe PWM limits:**
   - Type `z` to reset to safe zero
   - Select each servo (0-3)
   - Carefully increase PWM with `+`
   - **Stop BEFORE collision!**
   - Document limits in STATUS.md

4. **Update configuration:**
   - Edit animation-config.json with safe ranges
   - Run tests: `pixi run test`
   - Upload: `pixi run upload arduino/hatching_egg`

---

## üí° Recommendations for Next Agent

1. **Test conservatively** - Better to have smaller range than risk damage
2. **Use `z` liberally** - Reset to safe zero often
3. **Document as you go** - Write down PWM values immediately
4. **One servo at a time** - Don't test multiple simultaneously
5. **Verify direction** - Some servos might be mirrored
