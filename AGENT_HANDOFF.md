## âœ… Completed: Twitching Body Animatronic (PRODUCTION READY)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - Tested with hardware, ready for deployment

**Location:** `twitching_body/`

**What was accomplished:**
1. âœ… PCA9685 + HS-755MG servo integration (production code complete)
2. âœ… Complete wiring diagrams (`WIRING.md`)
3. âœ… Calibrated pulse widths (600-2400Âµs) - prevents servo stalling
4. âœ… Integer overflow fix applied
5. âœ… Interactive testing workflow (`pixi run servo-test`)
6. âœ… Center button feature (Pin 9 - ground to center servos)
7. âœ… Opposite arm motion implemented (dramatic effect)

9. âœ… Comprehensive documentation (README, TROUBLESHOOTING, SERVO_TEST)
10. âœ… Port auto-detection and process cleanup tools
11. âœ… Hardware tested and verified working

**Hardware:**
- DFRobot Beetle (DFR0282)
- PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver (I2C, address 0x40)
- 3x HS-755MG high-torque servos (head, left arm, right arm)
- 5V 5A+ power supply

**Behavior:**
- Autonomous (no sensors, always running)
- Mostly still (70-85% of time)
- Slow movements Â±15Â° with opposite arm motion (10-20%)
- Quick jerks Â±35Â° with opposite arm motion (5-10%)
- 5 varying cycles for unpredictability
- Center button for easy servo horn installation

**Key files:**
- `README.md` - Complete setup guide
- `WIRING.md` - Detailed wiring diagrams
- `SERVO_TEST.md` - Interactive testing guide
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Problem-solving
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete history
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` - Session notes

**Testing verified:**
```bash
cd twitching_body
pixi run deploy  # âœ… All tests pass, servos work perfectly
```

**Ready for deployment:**
- All servos move smoothly
- No servo stalling or high current draw
- Center button works
- Opposite arm motion creates dramatic effect
- Production code complete and tested

## Next Task: [Choose Next Chamber Effect]

### Options from PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Chamber 2 Effects (Spider Web Tunnel):**
- ~~Window Animation Scare~~ âœ… COMPLETE (`window_spider_trigger/`)
- Projector Spider Crawl (video loop on ceiling/walls)
- Ankle Brusher (pool noodle sweep with servo)

**Chamber 3 (Trash Room):**
- Robot Arm Scares (2x arms with pool noodles)

**Chamber 4 (Victim Room):**
- ~~Twitching Body~~ âœ… COMPLETE (`twitching_body/`)
- Dripping Effect (LED or projected)

**Chamber 5 (Hatchery):**
- Pulsating Egg Sacs (LED breathing pattern)
- Scavenger Hunt Container

**Chamber 6 (Spider's Lair):**
- Baby Spider Projection (floor/walls)
- Giant Animatronic Spider (track slider or multi-servo)

### Recommended Next: Pulsating Egg Sacs (Chamber 5)

**Why:**
- Similar to completed projects (LED control, Arduino)
- Can use PCA9685 for 16+ LED channels
- Good practice before complex spider animatronic
- Independent effect (doesn't depend on other chambers)

**Approach:**
- Pixi-based environment
- Arduino + PCA9685 for LED control
- Breathing/pulsing algorithm (slow fade in/out)
- Random variations between egg sacs
- Test-first methodology

## Key Learnings from Twitching Body Session

1. **F() macro is essential** - Reduces RAM by 50% on memory-constrained boards
2. **Auto-detection over hardcoding** - Ports can vary, always auto-detect
3. **Test code first, production later** - Verify hardware works before complex behavior
4. **Pixi shell parsing is finicky** - Use `bash -c` wrapper for complex commands
5. **Comprehensive wiring diagrams save time** - ASCII art + tables prevent mistakes
6. **Interactive test commands are powerful** - Serial commands make debugging intuitive
7. **Process cleanup tools are critical** - Stuck uploads can consume CPU indefinitely
8. **Document hardware specs thoroughly** - High-current servos need explicit power warnings

## Key Learnings from Window Spider Session

1. **Read the code** - Don't assume files are needed, verify by tracing usage
2. **Test immediately** - Integration tests caught issues early
3. **Document progressively** - Prevented context loss during agent shutdowns
4. **Audit regularly** - Found unnecessary symlinks, obsolete commands, unused CSS
5. **Keep it lean** - Single-purpose, no "just in case" elements

---

## For Next Agent

**First commands:**
```bash
# Understand the project
cat PROJECT_PLAN.md
cat AGENT_HANDOFF.md

# Review completed work
cd window_spider_trigger
cat README.md
pixi run status

cd ../twitching_body
cat README.md
cat AGENT_HANDOFF.md
pixi run status

# Read agent instructions
cat ../.claude/claude.md

# If testing twitching body hardware:
cd twitching_body
cat WIRING.md        # Complete wiring guide
cat SERVO_TEST.md    # Testing procedures
pixi run servo-test  # Interactive hardware test

# If starting new effect:
cd ..
# Use window_spider_trigger/ and twitching_body/ as templates
```

**Remember:**
- Test first, always (especially hardware before production code)
- Document as you work (update CHANGELOG.md, AGENT_HANDOFF.md)
- Use Pixi for everything (no system packages)
- F() macro for strings on memory-constrained boards
- Auto-detect ports, never hardcode
- Comprehensive wiring diagrams prevent hours of debugging
- Audit code before completing (remove unused elements)
- Keep it lean and focused

**Standards Applied Successfully:**
âœ… Pixi-managed dependencies
âœ… Memory optimization (F() macro)
âœ… Auto port detection
âœ… Interactive test workflows
âœ… Comprehensive documentation
âœ… Process cleanup tools
âœ… Test before production

Good luck! ðŸŽƒ
