# Agent Handoff Notes

## Session: 2025-10-14 (Evening)

### Completed: Window Spider Trigger âœ…

**Status:** Production-ready, fully tested, documented, and audited

**Location:** `window_spider_trigger/`

**What was accomplished:**
1. âœ… Single-video playback system (pause â†’ trigger â†’ play â†’ reset â†’ pause)
2. âœ… DFRobot Beetle integration (Pin 9 switch trigger)
3. âœ… Node.js server with Socket.IO real-time communication
4. âœ… Automated testing suite (integration + hardware tests)
5. âœ… Documentation consolidation (13 files â†’ 4 files)
6. âœ… Code audit (removed unused symlinks, CSS, PIR references)
7. âœ… Pixi-based reproducible environment

**Key files:**
- `README.md` - Complete setup and usage
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Testing procedures and fixes
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Full history of changes
- `.claude/claude.md` - Agent instructions and hygiene standards

**Testing verified:**
```bash
cd window_spider_trigger
pixi run integration-test  # âœ… All 5 tests pass
```

## Next Task: Twitching Body Animatronic

### Overview

Create servo-controlled body twitching system for haunted house effect.

### Details from PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Likely Chamber:** 4 (Coffin Room) or 5 (Morgue)

**Effect concept:**
- Body/corpse that twitches and jerks
- Servo motors controlling limb movements
- Triggered by proximity or button
- Random twitch patterns for realism

### Recommended Approach

**Hardware:**
- Arduino (Beetle or standard)
- Servo motors (2-4 for different body parts)
- Proximity sensor or switch trigger
- Power supply for servos

**Software:**
- Similar architecture to window_spider_trigger
- Pixi-based environment
- Servo control library
- Pattern/timing system for realistic twitches

**Standards to follow:**
1. **Pixi environment** - All dependencies managed
2. **Test-first** - Create integration tests early
3. **Document as you go** - Update markdown files immediately
4. **Code hygiene** - Audit for unused elements before completion
5. **Single purpose** - Keep it lean and focused

### Reference Implementation

Use `window_spider_trigger/` as template:
- File structure
- Pixi configuration approach
- Testing methodology
- Documentation style
- Code organization

### Starting Points

1. **Read `/PROJECT_PLAN.md`** - Understand full haunted house design
2. **Review `window_spider_trigger/`** - See working example
3. **Check `.claude/claude.md`** - Agent instructions and standards
4. **Create new directory** - E.g., `twitching_body/` or `coffin_animatronic/`
5. **Start with hardware test** - Verify servo control before building full system

## Session Stats

**Duration:** ~2.5 hours
**Commits:** 5 major commits
- Initial implementation
- Video cleanup
- Documentation consolidation
- PIR/CSS cleanup
- Code audit

**Lines changed:**
- Documentation: -82% (consolidated)
- Code: Streamlined (removed unused CSS, symlinks)
- Tests: Updated for actual usage

**Token usage:** ~122k / 200k (61%)

## Key Learnings from This Session

1. **Read the code** - Don't assume files are needed, verify by tracing usage
2. **Test immediately** - Integration tests caught issues early
3. **Document progressively** - Prevented context loss during agent shutdowns
4. **Audit regularly** - Found unnecessary symlinks, obsolete commands, unused CSS
5. **Keep it lean** - Single-purpose, no "just in case" elements

---

## For Next Agent

**First commands:**
```bash
# Understand the project
cat PROJECT_PLAN.md

# Review completed work
cd window_spider_trigger
cat README.md
pixi run status
pixi run integration-test

# Read agent instructions
cat ../.claude/claude.md

# Then start on twitching body
cd ..
mkdir twitching_body  # or appropriate name
# Apply same standards as window_spider_trigger
```

**Remember:**
- Test first, always
- Document as you work
- Use Pixi for everything
- Audit code before completing
- Keep it lean and focused

Good luck! ðŸŽƒ
