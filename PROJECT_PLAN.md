- **Bases**: Body-shaped forms (pool noodles bent into shape, mannequins, or inflatable figures)
- **Wrapping**: Loose gauze/cheesecloth allowing movement visibility
- **Suspension**: Strong hooks in ceiling, adjustable rope/chain
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Small motors inside for twitching (oscillating fans on low, phone vibration motors)
  - OR actors in some cocoons for realistic movement
  - Sound-activated twitching (vibration motors triggered by audio)

#### Movement & Effects
- **Twitching**: Random intervals via timer-controlled motors
- **Moaning**: Hidden Bluetooth speakers inside or behind cocoons
- **Audio**: Pre-recorded victim sounds (moaning, whimpering, muffled cries for help)

#### Dripping Effect Ideas
- **Option A (Dry)**: LED strips with animated "drip" pattern (red LEDs) + clear fishing line with red plastic "droplets"
- **Option B (Wet - Controlled)**: Slow-drip system with pump and tubing, collecting in bucket below (use water with red dye or clear slime)
- **Option C (Illusion)**: Projected dripping animation from above
- **Recommendation**: Option A (cleanest) or C (most dramatic)

### Environment
- **Lighting**: Flickering overhead (fluorescent tubes), spotlights on key cocoons
- **Sound**: Victim moans, wet sounds, chain rattling (Bluetooth speaker)
- **Temperature**: If possible, make slightly warmer/more humid (discomfort factor)

---

## Chamber 5: HATCHERY

### Purpose
Spider nursery - eggs about to hatch

### Setup Requirements

#### Egg Sacs
- **Construction**: Balloons or paper lanterns wrapped in webbing/gauze
- **Sizes**: Various (6" to 18" diameter)
- **Quantity**: 20-40 sacs covering ceiling and walls
- **Clustering**: Groups of 3-7 sacs together

#### Glowing & Pulsating Effects
- **Lighting**: LED lights inside each sac
- **Colors**: Sickly yellow-green, pale purple, or amber
- **Pulsating**:
  - Electronic: LED strips controlled by Arduino/ESP32 with breathing program
  - Simple: Christmas light controllers with fade function
  - Advanced: Synchronized pulse pattern across all sacs
- **Pattern**: Slow pulse (2-4 second cycle), random variations to simulate different maturity

#### Scavenger Hunt Element
**Container Options (Unnerving to Reach Into):**
- **Option A**: Large egg sac (opaque fabric) with opening at bottom - must reach up into it blindly
- **Option B**: "Feeding trough" - shallow container filled with slime/jello with object hidden inside
- **Option C**: Hollowed out cocoon body with opening in chest/stomach area
- **Option D**: Crack in wall (foam board construction) with sticky webbing inside
- **Recommendation**: Option A or C - reaching into unknown space is psychologically effective

**What They're Retrieving**: Plastic spider token, laminated card, or game piece

### Environment
- **Webbing**: Dense coverage, especially around egg clusters
- **Lighting**: UV blacklight makes whites glow, dim ambient light
- **Sound**: Wet squelching, chittering baby spiders, cracking eggs (Bluetooth speaker)
- **Movement**: Fans create gentle sac swaying
- **Details**: Some cracked eggs with baby spider props emerging

---

## Chamber 6: SPIDER'S LAIR

### Purpose
Final confrontation - mama spider's domain

### Setup Requirements

#### Baby Spiders
- **Method**: Projector displaying animated baby spiders
- **Content**: Video of small spiders crawling on floor/walls
- **Projection Surface**: Floor and lower walls (light colored fabric/paint)
- **Effect**: Appears that floor is covered in spiders
- **Enhancement**: Some physical props (fake spiders) mixed with projection for 3D effect

#### Giant Animatronic Spider
**Design Options (Electronics Only - No Pneumatics):**

**Option A - Linear Actuator Lunge (Recommended)**
- **Mechanism**: Heavy-duty linear actuator (12V/24V, 12"-18" stroke)
- **Action**: Spider lunges forward 1-2 feet when triggered, then retracts
- **Mounting**: Spider mounted on sliding frame/track system
- **Speed**: Fast extension (scary lunge), slower retraction (reset)
- **Safety**: Limit switches at both ends, stops 4-5 feet from victims
- **Reset**: Automatic retraction after 2-3 seconds

**Option B - Servo-Driven Multi-Movement (Easier Build)**
- **Mechanism**: 6-8 high-torque servo motors (25kg+ torque)
- **Actions**:
  - Front legs reach forward and down
  - Body tilts/rocks forward
  - Mandibles open/snap
  - Abdomen lifts slightly
- **Advantage**: No full-body movement, easier to mount, reliable
- **Effect**: Combined movements create illusion of aggressive lunge
- **Enhancement**: Strobe light makes jerky servo movements look more chaotic

**Option C - Drop-and-Swing on Motor (Dramatic)**
- **Mechanism**: Worm-gear motor or windshield wiper motor
- **Action**: Spider suspended on motorized pivot drops/swings down toward victims
- **Arc**: 45-60 degree swing, stops at safe distance
- **Reset**: Motor reverses to raise spider back up
- **Safety**: Physical stop, counterweight system
- **Advantage**: Dramatic overhead attack feel

**Option D - Track Slider System (Most Reliable)**
- **Mechanism**: Stepper motor or DC gearmotor driving belt/chain on linear rail
- **Action**: Spider slides forward 2-4 feet rapidly on ceiling or wall track
- **Speed**: Variable - can accelerate toward victims then stop suddenly
- **Reset**: Reverses to starting position automatically
- **Safety**: Mechanical end stops, limit switches
- **Advantage**: Smooth, fast, repeatable, easy to control

**RECOMMENDED CHOICE: Option D (Track Slider) or Option B (Multi-Servo)**
- Track slider gives best lunge effect without pneumatics
- Multi-servo is easier to build and more reliable

**Construction:**
- **Body**: Large trash can, paper mache, or foam core (3-4 feet diameter)
- **Legs**: Pool noodles, PVC pipe, or foam (8 legs, 4-6 feet long)
- **Eyes**: LED lights (red or green, can pulse/glow brighter during lunge)
- **Details**: Fur texture, painted details, servo-actuated mandibles that snap

**Trigger**: Motion sensor at entrance (PIR sensor)
**Controller**: Arduino Mega or ESP32 to coordinate all movements with strobe

#### Strobe Light System
- **Placement**: Overhead, focused on spider
- **Activation**: Triggered with spider lunge
- **Duration**: 3-5 seconds
- **Effect**: Disorientation + creates jerky spider movement illusion
- **Additional**: Red or purple strobe (more unsettling than white)

### Environment
- **Webbing**: Heaviest concentration, large web behind spider
- **Lighting**: Very dim ambient, sudden bright with strobe during scare
- **Sound**: Deep hissing, spider screech during lunge (large speaker)
- **Exit**: Clearly marked after scare, rapid escape route
